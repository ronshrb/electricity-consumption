# Time Series Forecasting for Electricity Demand: Conclusions and Summary

## Project Overview

This project aimed to develop accurate forecasting models for electricity demand using historical consumption data. We implemented and compared three different approaches to time series forecasting using XGBoost:

1. **Direct Forecasting**: Training separate models for each time step in the forecast horizon
2. **Recursive Forecasting**: Using predictions as inputs for subsequent forecasts
3. **SKForecast Implementation**: Utilizing the specialized time series forecasting library

Our analysis focused on both short-term (48 periods/1 day) and long-term (up to 1008 periods/21 days) forecasting, with comprehensive evaluation using multiple metrics.

## Key Findings

### 1. Comparative Model Performance

- **Best Overall Performance**: Recursive XGBoost consistently outperformed the other approaches across all forecast horizons, with the lowest error rates on all metrics.
- **Performance Ranking**: Recursive XGBoost > SKForecast > Direct XGBoost
- **Short-term Forecasting (1 day)**: 
  - Recursive XGBoost: 4.70% MAPE
  - SKForecast: 4.99% MAPE
  - Direct XGBoost: 15.60% MAPE
- **Long-term Forecasting (21 days)**:
  - Recursive XGBoost: 10.68% MAPE
  - SKForecast: 11.86% MAPE
  - Direct XGBoost: 21.05% MAPE

### 2. Performance Degradation with Horizon Extension

- All models showed degraded performance as the forecast horizon increased, but at different rates:
  - **Direct XGBoost**: Showed the steepest degradation, with MAPE increasing from 15.60% (1 day) to 21.05% (21 days), a 35% increase
  - **Recursive XGBoost**: Showed a more controlled degradation, with MAPE increasing from 4.70% (1 day) to 10.68% (21 days), a 127% increase
  - **SKForecast**: Similar pattern to Recursive XGBoost, with MAPE increasing from 4.99% (1 day) to 11.86% (21 days), a 137% increase

### 3. Feature Importance Analysis

- **Lag Features**: Recent lag features (especially lag_1 to lag_5) were consistently the most important predictors across all models
- **Time-Based Features**: 'hour', 'day_of_week', and 'is_weekend' were significant non-lag features
- **Seasonal Indicators**: Features like 'month', 'quarter', and 'day_of_year' had moderate importance, confirming seasonal patterns in electricity demand

### 4. Model Characteristics

- **Recursive XGBoost**:
  - Pros: Most accurate across all horizons, better handles the temporal dependencies
  - Cons: Cumulative error propagation in very long forecasts (although still outperforms alternatives)
  
- **SKForecast**:
  - Pros: Close performance to custom Recursive implementation, provides an out-of-the-box solution
  - Cons: Slightly less accurate than custom Recursive implementation, potentially less flexible for customization
  
- **Direct XGBoost**:
  - Pros: Conceptually simpler, easier to implement
  - Cons: Significantly worse performance, doesn't effectively capture temporal dependencies

### 5. Performance Stability

- **Variability Across Test Windows**:
  - All models showed varying performance across different test windows
  - Recursive XGBoost had the most consistent performance across test windows
  - Direct XGBoost showed the highest variability in performance

## Implications and Recommendations

1. **Methodology Selection**: For electricity demand forecasting, recursive approaches are strongly recommended over direct forecasting methods.

2. **Forecast Horizon Considerations**:
   - For short-term forecasting (1-3 days): Recursive XGBoost provides excellent accuracy with MAPE below 7%
   - For medium-term forecasting (4-10 days): Recursive XGBoost maintains acceptable accuracy with MAPE around 8-10%
   - For long-term forecasting (11+ days): Model performance begins to degrade notably, but Recursive XGBoost still provides the best available predictions

3. **Feature Engineering Strategy**:
   - Historical demand values (lags) are the most critical predictors
   - Time-based features significantly enhance model performance
   - Including both short-term and long-term lag features helps capture different temporal patterns

4. **Practical Applications**:
   - **Grid Operations**: The high accuracy of short-term forecasts (1-3 days) makes these models suitable for daily grid operations and resource allocation
   - **Energy Trading**: Medium-term forecasts (4-10 days) can support energy market trading strategies
   - **Infrastructure Planning**: Despite higher error rates, long-term forecasts (11+ days) still provide valuable directional insights for infrastructure planning

5. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Explore hybrid models combining the strengths of different approaches
   - Incorporate external factors such as weather data, economic indicators, and special events
   - Implement ensemble methods to further improve forecast accuracy
   - Consider deep learning approaches (LSTM, Transformer architectures) for handling complex temporal dependencies

## Technical Implementation Insights

1. **Model Optimization**:
   - XGBoost hyperparameters significantly impact model performance
   - The recursive implementation benefited from careful handling of lag features
   - Feature engineering played a crucial role in model accuracy

2. **Evaluation Framework**:
   - Walk-forward validation proved effective for realistic performance assessment
   - Multiple metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE) provided comprehensive evaluation
   - Testing across multiple start dates ensured robust performance evaluation

3. **Computational Considerations**:
   - Direct forecasting is more computationally intensive as it requires training multiple models
   - Recursive approaches are more efficient in terms of model training but require sequential prediction
   - SKForecast provides a good balance of performance and implementation ease

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the effectiveness of XGBoost-based models for electricity demand forecasting. The recursive approach consistently outperformed other methods, achieving impressive accuracy for both short and medium-term forecasts. The analysis of performance across different forecast horizons provides valuable insights for practical applications in energy planning and operations.

The results highlight the importance of appropriate methodology selection based on the specific forecasting needs, with recursive approaches being particularly well-suited for time series problems with strong temporal dependencies. The feature importance analysis confirms the critical role of recent historical values in predicting future demand, while also demonstrating the value of time-based features in capturing cyclical patterns in electricity consumption.

For future work, incorporating additional external factors and exploring ensemble or hybrid approaches could further enhance forecasting accuracy, especially for longer-term predictions.
